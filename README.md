# Census

A simple CRUD webapp for academic libraries to gather stats on usage of physical space.

# Dependencies

This app is written in Go & runs on Google App Engine so you will need to [download & install the Google Cloud SDK for Go](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/go/download) to work on it. Having done so, you can run the app locally using the usual command: `dev_appserver.py app.yaml`
